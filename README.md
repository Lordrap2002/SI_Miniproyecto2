## About The Project

Create a Zork-type video game, text mode using OpenAL. The video game had to build an auditory world consistent with the player's actions.

### Limitations
* The program must use the OpenAL library.
* The program can be developed in Python, C, C++ or Java.
* The story must be able to be read line by line, that is, the program must allow this.
* Each line of the story must have a piece of music or sound effect appropriate to what is being told and must also be positioned in space. 
* A graphical interface is not necessary, but a command line interface must be made that allows you to advance in the story.
* The story must have at least 50 lines of text, and it must be a complete story,
* The code must work.

### Built With

## Decision Making
The city environment plays a key role in creating a rich 3D soundscape. By taking into account the buildings' heights and various noise levels, we're able to map sounds to specific coordinates on the x, y, and z axes. This allows us to position sounds at different heights, reflecting how noises like traffic, voices, and distant sirens might come from above or below the player.In other words, to enhance the chaotic atmosphere, we interlocked multiple sounds—like to create a sense of immersion. 

By adjusting the intensity levels of each sound, you maintain a balance so that no single noise overwhelms the player, while still emphasizing the constant motion and unpredictability of the city.

## Roadmap

- [x] Choose a Programming Language
- [x] Decide the Plot
- [X] Write the Plot
- [X] Collect Audio Files
- [X] Code the plot into a Game
- [X] Publish
